## Rick Gilmore {-}

Rick Gilmore is Professor of [Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu) and Director of the Open Data and Developmental Science (ODDS) initiative with the [Penn State Child Study Center (CSC)](https://csc.la.psu.edu). He co-founded and co-directs the [Databrary](https://databrary.org) data repository, and serves as Co-PI on the [Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project](https://play-project.org). Gilmore served as inaugural director of the Penn State [Social, Life, & Engineering Sciences Imaging Center](https://imaging.psu.edu). His research examines the development of perception and action in infants, children, and adults using behavioral, neural, and computational methods.

## Frank Hillary {-}

Frank G. Hillary is a Professor of [Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu) and [Neurology](https://med.psu.edu/neurology) at Penn State. His research examines the influence of brain injury and disease on functional brain organization over the lifespan.  To do so, he incorporates cognitive testing, structural and functional MRI, and network neuroscience approaches (e.g., graph theory) in his work. There is a critical need in the neuroimaging literature for open code and data sharing and convergence on accepted methods to increase scientific reliability. Because of this, over the past 5 years Dr. Hillary's work has shifted to focus on the reproducibility of neuroimaging work in the study of brain disorders. He is the leader of an international working group, ENIGMA Brain Injury (see: https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-tbi/), focused on genetics and neuroimaging data sharing and reproducible science.

## Sai Koneru {-}

Sai Koneru is a graduate student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST)](https://ist.psu.edu).

## Nicole Lazar {-}

Nicole Lazar is Professor of [Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat) at Penn State. Her research interests include the foundations of statistical inference and the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. In particular, she has worked on fundamental inferential topics such as model selection, multiple testing problems, and likelihood theory, specifically in the context of modern large-scale data analysis problems. She has done pioneering work on the statistical analysis of cognitive neuroscience data, with a focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Most recently, Lazar has been involved in the application of topological data analysis methods to scientific questions of interest in psychology and climatology. These techniques are at the interface of statistics, mathematics, and computer science, and exemplify her cross-disciplinary approach to research. Lazar is the author of the book *The Statistical Analysis of Functional MRI Data* published by Springer.  Lazar is also Co-PI on an NSF-funded project on fostering open science education for graduate students [NSF-1955049](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1955049) which has led to the formation of the [Open Science Alliance](https://openscialliance.github.io/).

## Daisy Lei {-}

Daisy Lei is a PhD candidate at Penn State, pursuing a dual-title degree in [Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu) and [Language Science](https://cls.la.psu.edu). She is in Dr. Janet van Hell's Bilingualism and Language Development (BiLD) Lab. Her research interests include native- and nonnative-accented speech processing and word learning in monolinguals and bilinguals. She uses behavioral and neuropsychological (EEG) measurements in her research.

## Kevin McManus {-}

Kevin McManus is an Associate Professor of [Applied Linguistics](https://aplng.la.psu.edu) at Penn State, Director of the [Center for Language Acquisition](https://language.la.psu.edu), and Director of the [Center for Advanced Language Proficiency, Education, and Research](https://calper.la.psu.edu). His research focuses on second language acquisition, especially psycholinguistics, crosslinguistic influence, and instruction, and research methodology, including replication research and open science. 

## Hollie Mullin {-}

Hollie Mullin is a first year Clinical Psychology student in Dr. Frank Hillary’s lab at Penn State. Hollie would like to combine neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging to examine how abnormal aging and TBIs affect cognitive functioning and brain network organization. Hollie also hopes to address replicability issues in neuroimaging to better predict long term outcomes and enhance rehabilitation interventions for patients.

## Jenae Neiderhiser {-}

Jenae Neiderhiser is Distinguished Professor of [Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu) and [Human Development and Family Studies](https://hhd.psu.edu/hdfs). Dr. Neiderhiser’s research is focused on understanding how interpersonal relationships, especially those within the family, are influenced by genetic factors via gene-environment correlation and interaction and the subsequent links to later adjustment in children and adults. More recently her work has included the examination of prenatal and early life risks in relation to child and adult adjustment. Dr. Neiderhiser is interested in understanding how interpersonal relationships shape and are shaped by children throughout the lifespan. One of the more novel findings emerging from her current work is that prenatal and early life risks appear to be mechanisms by which genetic factors influence child adjustment. Dr. Neiderhiser has used a variety of genetically informed research designs to examine gene-environment interplay including a longitudinal adolescent twin/sibling design, a study of twin parents of an adolescent and their family, a prospective longitudinal parent-offspring adoption study, a study of preadolescent twin children oversampled for residing in high risk neighborhoods, and a large international data harmonization study including multiple adult twin samples. These studies include extensive assessment of the environment within the household, interpersonal relationships, adult and child adjustment, temperament and personality and other related measures and together span the lifespan.

## Alaina Pearce {-}

[Alaina Pearce](https://sites.psu.edu/alainapearce/) is Assistant Research Professor in the [Department of Nutritional Sciences](https://hhd.psu.edu/nutrition) and [Center for Childhood Obesity Research](https://hhd.psu.edu/ccor) and is an affiliate of the [Institute of Computational and Data Sciences](https://www.icds.psu.edu). Dr. Pearce is a cognitive neuroscientist and her research interests center on understanding on the reciprocal association between neurocognitive functioning and pediatric obesity. Dr. Pearce’s current research aims to: 1) characterize cognitive function, neural food-cue responsivity, and eating behaviors in children at high and low familial risk for obesity prior to the development of excess adiposity; 2) identify neurocognitive processes and eating behaviors that confer either risk or resiliency to pediatric obesity; and 3) characterize child eating behaviors through meal microstructure and computational modeling.
