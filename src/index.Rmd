This site documents and describes the 2023 Open Science Bootcamp to be held at the University Park campus of [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu) Wednesday, August 9 through Friday, August 11, 2023 at the [Marriott Foundation Building](#marriott-fdn-bldg) (and if needed [Keller Building](#keller-bldg)) on the Penn State University Park campus.

The Bootcamp is being planned by a hard-working [committee](program-planning-committee.html) of staff, graduate students, and faculty, many of whom also plan to present.

::: {.rmdwarning}

**TO REGISTER**: Visit <https://forms.gle/Q8fecFZXq6Yp2Cq69>.

:::

The Bootcamp would not be possible without the generosity and hard work of our [sponsors and supporters](#acknowledgements).

## Goals {-}

- To create a focal point for activity and learning related to open science practices.
- To accelerate the development of a community of scholars who are interested in open science.
- To plan next steps that will foster the emergence of a robust open science community at Penn State.

## Origins {-}

The Bootcamp is an outgrowth of discussions that emerged in early 2022 among some of the conference organizers and builds upon the lessons learned in an open science [survey](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/) that a number of Penn State researchers completed in late 2022 and early 2023.

It also builds upon the lessons learned in hosting bootcamps focused on the R programming language sponsored in [2017](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp/), [2018](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2018/), and [2019](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2019/) by [Psychology Department](https://psych.la.psu.edu) and [HDFS](https://hhd.psu.edu/hdfs) faculty.

## Logistics {-}

### Meals {-}

Breakfast and coffee will be provided on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings.

Lunch will be provided on Wednesday and Thursday.
The Bootcamp will end by lunch time on Friday.

We will have vegetarian and vegan food options.

### Locations {-}

Most in-person events at Bootcamp 2023 will be held in the newly renovated **Marriott Foundation Building** on the Penn State University Park campus.
