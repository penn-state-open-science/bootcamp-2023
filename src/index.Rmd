This site documents and describes the 2023 Open Science Bootcamp to be held at the University Park campus of [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu) Wednesday, August 9 through Friday, August 11, 2023 at the [Marriott Foundation Building](#marriott-fdn-bldg) (and if needed [Keller Building](#keller-bldg)) on the Penn State University Park campus.

The Bootcamp is being planned by a hard-working [committee](program-planning-committee.html) of staff, graduate students, and faculty, many of whom also plan to present.

:::

The Bootcamp would not be possible without the generosity and hard work of our [sponsors and supporters](#acknowledgements).

## Goals {-}

- To create a focal point for activity and learning related to open science practices.
- To accelerate the development of a community of scholars who are interested in open science.
- To plan next steps that will foster the emergence of a robust open science community at Penn State.


<!-- ### Remote participants {-} -->

<!-- Bootcamp 2023 will be streamed online at the following URL: -->

<!-- <https://psu.zoom.us/bootcamp-2023/> -->

<!-- All sessions will be recorded and made publicly available at a later date. -->

## Origins {-}

The Bootcamp is an outgrowth of discussions that emerged in early 2022 among some of the conference organizers and builds upon the lessons learned in an open science [survey](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/) that a number of Penn State researchers completed in late 2022 and early 2023.

It also builds upon the lessons learned in hosting bootcamps focused on the R programming language sponsored in [2017](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp/), [2018](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2018/), and [2019](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2019/) by [Psychology Department](https://psych.la.psu.edu) and [HDFS](https://hhd.psu.edu/hdfs) faculty.
