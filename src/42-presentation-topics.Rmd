### Keynote (Tim Errington) {- #keynote}

*Replication of preclinical cancer biology: Challenges or opportunities?*

The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology was a large-scale systematic investigation into the replicability of high-impact, preclinical cancer biology experiments. Overall, there were challenges at every stage of the research process to design and conduct the replications. It was hard to understand what was originally done, there was not always access to the original data or reagents to conduct the experiments, and model systems frequently did not behave as originally reported. The limited transparency and incomplete reporting made the efforts to replicate the findings much harder than was necessary. Of the replication experiments able to be completed, the evidence was much weaker on average than the original findings even though all the replications underwent peer review before conducting the experiments to maximize their quality and rigor. These findings suggest that there is unnecessary friction in the research process that may be slowing the advancement of knowledge, solutions, and treatments.

### Good enough practices for data and project management ([Alaina Pearce]) {- #howto_good_enough}

Best practices can be hard to implement, so what open science practices are both useful and “good enough” [@Wilson2017-ot] to have an impact on your work? What are the first steps you can take to make your data more FAIR [@Wilkinson2016-qr]? How can these practices improve your data lifecycle and/or pipeline (e.g., data use and re-use within and between labs)?

## How to do open science? {-}

These are some possible presentations for [Day 2](#day_1).
[Day 2](#day_2) would be conducted in 3-5 breakout sessions.

### Preregistration & registered reports ([Frank Hillary]) {- #howto_preregistration}

What is preregistration? What are registered reports? When and why would you want to use these tools?

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 50 min

*Offered*: [Thu PM Session 3](#day_2_pm_session_3)

### Replication studies ([Kevin McManus]) {- #howto_replication}

This session will provide an introduction and overview of the replication process in social science research, focusing on three components: (1) what is replication and why is it important? (2) considerations for selecting a study to replicate (3) recommended practices for executing and writing up a replication study. Taken together, this session seeks to address several questions on the conceptual and practical aspects of doing replication research.

### Reproducible research with R Markdown and Quarto ([Rick Gilmore] & [Jennifer Valcin]){- #howto_rmarkdown}

This workshop will demonstrate how to create reproducible research workflows with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and its successor, [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
These tools can be used to analysis reports, create slides, papers, and web sites (like this one) using the same source materials.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 50 min

*Offered*: [Thu AM Session 2](#day_2_am_session_2).

### Data management: Policies ([Briana Wham] & [Alaina Pearce]) {- #howto_data_management_policies}

How to manage data to meet funder requirements and make sharing with collaborators and other researchers less burdensome.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: All

*Time required*: 50 min

*Offered*: [Thurs AM Session 1](#day_2_am_session_1).

### Data management: Practicalities ([Alaina Pearce] & [Briana Wham]) {- #howto_data_management_practical}

How can you manage data to make sharing with collaborators and other researchers less burdensome? Data management is often learned through trial and error. Therefore, this workshop will provide a set of practices that can make data management and data sharing easier. After a brief overview, this will be a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure workshop so we can dive into the details of data management that will be most helpful for you. Examples include discussing file naming conventions, directory organization for large lab projects, standardized data architectures (e.g., [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io); [MIxS](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/)), how to make a data dictionary, and data manipulation/creation of new variables.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: All

*Time required*: 50 min

*Offered*: [Thurs PM Session 3](#day_2_pm_session_3).

### Where to start? Open science for early career researchers ([Daisy Lei], [Hollie Mullin], [Mike Burnham], & [Sai Koneru]) {- #howto_early_career}

### Data & materials sharing: Why, when, where, & how ([Rick Gilmore] & [Bruce Desmarais]) {- #howto_data_sharing}

Where can you share data and materials?
Where *should* you share data and materials?
*When* can and should you share data and materials?
This workshop will demonstrate how researchers can use [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org), the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io), [Databrary](https://databrary.org), and other data and materials repositories both to share data and materials and to re-purpose data and materials shared by others.
The workshop will also discuss recent initiatives in some fields that require
data and code sharing prior to the publication of an article so that statistical
results and figures can be verified.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 50 min

*Offered*: [Thu PM Session 4](#day_2_pm_session_4)

<!-- ### Case study: Big data behavioral science: The Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project ([Rick Gilmore]) {- #casestudy_PLAY} -->

<!-- The [Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project](https://play-project.org) is an [NIH-funded research project](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/PJYxIpAvQkyD2ZNPUPbp8Q/project-details/9500957) that is recording, annotating, and sharing video recordings of mothers and their infants engaged in natural activities in the home. -->
<!-- In addition to providing a first-of-its-kind openly shared video corpus of natural behavior via [Databrary](https://databrary.org), PLAY's entire [protocol](https://play-project.org) is openly shared on the web, and the project's survey data results are [openly summarized](https://PLAY-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/) and regularly updated. As such, PLAY provides a test-case for how open science practices work in a large-scale, geographically distributed research project that collects and intends to share identifiable data. -->
