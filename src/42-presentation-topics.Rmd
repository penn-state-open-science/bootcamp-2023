# Presentation topics {-}

The following are potential presentation topics we are considering for [Day 1](#day_1) and [Day 2](#day_2).

These are also topics that might be offered later on after the bootcamp.

Some of the presentations have been suggsted by a specific person, and others are topics that Rick Gilmore thought might be appropriate for a person or group.
The person indicated in the parentheses is the tentative or proposed coordinator for that workshop as of `r Sys.Date()`.
Question marks (?) indicate that the person has not yet confirmed their interest or availability.
The information is merely for planning purposes.

## What is open science? Why do open science? {-}

These are some possible presentations for [Day 1](#day_1).

### Keynote (TBD) {- #keynote}

### Case study: Reproducibility in neuroimaging ([Frank Hillary]? & [Nicole Lazar]?) {- #casestudy_neuroimaging}

*Prerequisites*: 

*Skill level*: 

*Time required*: 

### Case study: Big data behavioral science: The Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project ([Rick Gilmore]) {- #casestudy_PLAY}

The [Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project](https://play-project.org) is an [NIH-funded research project](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/PJYxIpAvQkyD2ZNPUPbp8Q/project-details/9500957) that is recording, annotating, and sharing video recordings of mothers and their infants engaged in natural activities in the home.
In addition to providing a first-of-its-kind openly shared video corpus of natural behavior via [Databrary](https://databrary.org), PLAY's entire [protocol](https://play-project.org) is openly shared on the web, and the project's survey data results are [openly summarized](https://PLAY-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/) and regularly updated. As such, PLAY provides a test-case for how open science practices work in a large-scale, geographically distributed research project that collects and intends to share identifiable data.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 30 min

### Reproducible research in economics ([Lars Vilhuber](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/lars-vilhuber), Cornell?) {- #casestudy_economics}

### Reproducible and robust research has wider reach (?) {- #howto_reproducibility}

Types of reproducibility. How building reproducible research workflows can make your work more robust and more readily shareable.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 30 min

## How to do open science? {-}

These are some possible presentations for [Day 2](#day_1).
[Day 2](#day_2) would be conducted in 3-5 breakout sessions.

### Preregistration & registered reports ([Bruce Desmarais]?) {- #howto_preregistration}

What is preregistration? What are preregistered reports? When and why would you want to use these tools?

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 30 min

### Replication ([Kevin McManus]) {- #howto_replication}

Why are replication studies important? How to plan, conduct, and publish replication studies.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 30 min


### Responsible and robust research (?) {- #howto_responsible_research}

What are questionable research practices? Why are they questionable? How do we avoid them?

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 30 min

### Literate Programming with R Markdown and Quarto ([Rick Gilmore]){- #howto_rmarkdown}

What is literate programming? 
How can literate programming tools improve your research productivity? 
This workshop will demonstrate the many uses of [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and its successor, [Quarto](https://quarto.org) in research, teaching, and service.
These tools can be used to create slides, analysis reports, papers, and web sites (like this one) using the same source materials.
[Rick Gilmore] considers these tools super-powers.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 2 hrs (could extend to 3-4 if needed)

### Literate programming with Jupyter notebooks ([Mike Burnham]) {- #howto_jupyter}

[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) are another literate programming tool, and also another research super-power.

*Prerequisites*: 

*Skill level*: 

*Time required*: 

### Version control with git, GitHub, and GitLab ([Alaina Pearce]? & [Carrie Brown]) {- #howto_git}

*Prerequisites*: 

*Skill level*: 

*Time required*: 2-4 hrs.

### Open access publishing ([Briana Wham]?) {- #howto_open_access}

Where and how to share your research so that the maximum number of people can read it.

### Sharing data and materials ([Rick Gilmore] & [Bruce Desmarais]?) {- #howto_data_sharing}

Where can you share data and materials?
Where *should* you share data and materials?
This workshop will demonstrate how researchers can use the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io), [Databrary](https://databrary.org), and other data and materials repositories both to share data and materials and to repurpose data and materials shared by others.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 30-45 min

### Good enough practices for data and project management (?) {- #howto_good_enough}

Best practices can be hard to implement, so what open science practices are both ueseful and "good enough" [@Wilson2017-ot](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) to have an impact on your work?

### Data management ([Briana Wham]?) {- #howto_data_management}

How to manage data to meet funder requirements and make sharing with collaborators and other researchers less burdensome.

### Where to start? Open science for early career researchers ([Daisy Lei]?, [Hollie Mullin]?, [Mike Burnham]?, & [Sai Koneru]?) {- #howto_early_career}

How can early career researchers start easing-in to their open science journey [@Kathawalla2021-tk](https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.18684)?

### Reproducible software ([Carrie Brown]?) {- #reproducible-software}

How to make your code reproducible; Conda; software environments, etc.

*Prerequisites*: 

*Skill level*: 

*Time required*:
