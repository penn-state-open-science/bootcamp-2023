# Presentation topics {-}

The following are potential presentation topics we are considering for [Day 1](#day_1) and [Day 2](#day_2).

These are also topics that might be offered later on after the bootcamp.

Some of the presentations have been suggested by a specific person, and others are topics that Rick Gilmore thought might be appropriate for a person or group.
The person indicated in the parentheses is the tentative or proposed coordinator for that workshop as of `r Sys.Date()`.
Question marks (?) indicate that the person has not yet confirmed their interest or availability.
The information is merely for planning purposes.
Which hands-on topics we offer will be shaped by the preferences of prospective participants, as indicated in a May 2023 [survey](attendee-surveys.html#results).

### Keynote (Tim Errington) {- #keynote}

### Good enough practices for data and project management ([Alaina Pearce]) {- #howto_good_enough}

Best practices can be hard to implement, so what open science practices are both ueseful and "good enough" [@Wilson2017-ot] to have an impact on your work?  How can researchers make their data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable--adhere to the FAIR data principles [@Wilkinson2016-qr]? How can these practices improve your data lifecycle and/or pipeline (e.g., data use and re-use within and between labs)?

## How to do open science? {-}

These are some possible presentations for [Day 2](#day_1).
[Day 2](#day_2) would be conducted in 3-5 breakout sessions.

### Literate Programming with R Markdown and Quarto ([Rick Gilmore] & [Jennifer Valcin]){- #howto_rmarkdown}

What is literate programming? 
How can literate programming tools improve your research productivity? 
This workshop will demonstrate the many uses of [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and its successor, [Quarto](https://quarto.org) in research, teaching, and service.
These tools can be used to create slides, analysis reports, papers, and web sites (like this one) using the same source materials.
[Rick Gilmore] considers these tools super-powers.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 50 min

*Offered*: [Thu AM Session 2](#day_2_am_session_2).

### Data management policies ([Briana Wham] & [Alaina Pearce]) {- #howto_data_management_policies}

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: All

*Time required*: 50 min

*Offered*: [Thurs AM Session 1](#day_2_am_session_1).

### Data management: Practicalities ([Alaina Pearce] & [Briana Wham]) {- #howto_data_management_practical}

### Sharing data and materials ([Rick Gilmore] & [Bruce Desmarais]) {- #howto_data_sharing}

Where can you share data and materials?
Where *should* you share data and materials?
*When* can and should you share data and materials?
This workshop will demonstrate how researchers can use [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org), the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io), [Databrary](https://databrary.org), and other data and materials repositories both to share data and materials and to repurpose data and materials shared by others.
The workshop will also discuss recent initiatives in some fields that require
data and code sharing prior to the publication of an article so that statistical
results and figures can be verified.

*Prerequisites*: None

*Skill level*: Novice

*Time required*: 50 min

*Offered*: [Thu PM Session 4](#day_2_pm_session_4)

### Case study: Big data behavioral science: The Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project ([Rick Gilmore]) {- #casestudy_PLAY}

The [Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project](https://play-project.org) is an [NIH-funded research project](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/PJYxIpAvQkyD2ZNPUPbp8Q/project-details/9500957) that is recording, annotating, and sharing video recordings of mothers and their infants engaged in natural activities in the home.
In addition to providing a first-of-its-kind openly shared video corpus of natural behavior via [Databrary](https://databrary.org), PLAY's entire [protocol](https://play-project.org) is openly shared on the web, and the project's survey data results are [openly summarized](https://PLAY-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/) and regularly updated. As such, PLAY provides a test-case for how open science practices work in a large-scale, geographically distributed research project that collects and intends to share identifiable data.
